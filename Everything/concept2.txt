Awesome — here’s a **detailed, battle-ready build plan** for the **Youth Mental Wellness** challenge. I’m giving you a complete product + tech blueprint you can start implementing today.

---

# What to build (clear, winnable scope)

## MVP (must-have for judges)

1. **Anonymous, empathetic chat**

   * Multilingual (English + Hindi; add 1 regional language if possible).
   * Tone: warm, non-judgmental, no medical diagnoses.
2. **Mood check-ins & journaling**

   * Short text check-in → sentiment/mood tag → 7-day trend.
   * Optional “ephemeral mode” (no storage).
3. **Micro-interventions**

   * 60–120s actions: 4-7-8 breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, quick reframing, sleep wind-down.
4. **Crisis detection & escalation**

   * Detect self-harm/danger cues → show helpline card + call button + opt-in connect-to-human.
5. **Privacy by design**

   * Anonymous use, minimal logging, clear disclaimers.

## Nice-to-have (if time permits)

* Voice input/output.
* Peer “support rooms” (read-only broadcast of curated tips; no open chat).
* Stigma-aware resources (how to talk to parents/teachers, low-cost counseling map).

---

# User journeys (demoable)

1. **Daily check-in**

* User types: “Aaj thoda anxious hoon.”
* System labels mood (e.g., *Anxious 6/10*), replies with empathy + 90-sec breathing.
* Trend chart updates; user can mark “felt better? 👍/👎”.

2. **Study stress coaching**

* “Assignments pile up ho rahe.”
* System: reflective summary → 3 actionable steps → mini scheduling prompt.

3. **Crisis signal**

* “Mann kar raha khud ko nuksan pahunchaun.”
* System immediately: grounding steps + helpline + “connect to volunteer/counselor” (no advice beyond safety, no minimization).

---

# Safety, ethics, compliance (judges will ask)

* **Not a clinician**: visible disclaimer on first use + in chat header.
* **Crisis protocol**: immediate surface of helplines; never hide behind menus.
* **Data minimization**: default ephemeral; if user opts-in to history, encrypt at rest.
* **PII redaction**: detect phone, email, address → mask before storage.
* **Human-in-loop**: flagged crisis events can notify a moderator (demo with a mock dashboard).

---

# Architecture (lean and fast)

**Frontend (React / plain HTML+JS)**

* Pages: Onboarding, Chat, Check-ins, Trends, Resources, Settings.
* Components: Chat bubble, Mood chip, Breath timer, Trend chart, Crisis banner.

**Backend (Flask)**

* `/chat`: routes user message → safety prefilter → LLM → post-processor.
* `/mood`: returns mood label & intensity from text (fast classifier or LLM).
* `/trend`: reads/saves minimal mood snapshots (if not ephemeral).
* `/resources`: static curated JSON (regional helplines, student services).
* `/flag`: writes a minimal, encrypted crisis flag (only on user consent).

**AI**

* Primary: **Gemini** (via Google AI Studio API).
* Guardrails: safety-first system prompt + few-shot empathy + crisis playbook.
* Optional: lightweight keyword/regex crisis prefilter before LLM.

**Storage**

* Default: session-only (no DB).
* Optional opt-in: SQLite/Firestore-equivalent for 7-day trend (encrypted).
* Secrets via env vars; HTTPS everywhere.

# Model instructions (drop-in)

**System prompt (short, safe)**

> You are “Sakhi,” a warm, non-judgmental wellness companion for Indian youth. Use simple, supportive language. Offer coping skills and resources; do not diagnose or prescribe. If self-harm or imminent danger is detected, immediately follow the crisis protocol: (1) validate feelings, (2) guide a 60-second grounding, (3) show local helpline and ask to connect to a trusted adult or counselor. Keep responses brief, actionable, and culturally sensitive. Support English, Hindi, and mixed Hinglish.

**Few-shot intents to cover**

* Empathy + reflective listening.
* Study stress → 3 concrete steps.
* Sleep hygiene micro-plan.
* Social stigma conversation (parents/peers) → respectful framing.
* Crisis detection example → correct escalation response.
* Code-switching (English↔Hindi) on user request.

---

# Crisis detection heuristics (defense-in-depth)

**Conservative keyword set (expand to Hinglish/Hindi):**
“suicide”, “kill myself”, “end my life”, “self-harm”, “hurt myself”, “ab jeena nahi”, “marna”, “zindagi khatam”, “zeher”, “rope”, “blade”, “jump”, “khud ko nuksan”, “katna”, “apni jaan”, “mar jaaun”.

* If hit → skip normal chat; render **Crisis UI** and crisis-prompt to LLM.
* Log only a hashed flag + timestamp (no raw text) if user consents.

---

# Acceptance criteria (so you know when it’s “done”)

* **Chat**: avg response < 2.5s; tone stays supportive; no diagnosis phrasing.
* **Mood**: labels agree with human judgment on 20 sample inputs ≥ 80%.
* **Interventions**: each < 2 minutes, step-by-step, tappable timer.
* **Crisis**: 100% of test phrases trigger crisis UI within 1s; no false reassurance.
* **Privacy**: ephemeral mode leaves no entries after refresh; opt-in storage is encrypted.

---

# Evaluation plan (for the pitch)

* **Safety**: confusion matrix on a 60-phrase crisis set (Hindi/English/Hinglish).
* **User uplift**: pre/post emoji (“How do you feel now?”) → show sample uplift.
* **Latency**: dashboard shows p50/p95 response times.
* **Localization**: quick demo of language switch.

---

# Build order (3-day sprint)

**Day 1**

* Frontend skeleton, chat UI, settings (ephemeral toggle).
* Flask endpoints + Gemini integration.
* Safety prefilter + crisis UI.

**Day 2**

* Mood tagging + 7-day trend (opt-in storage).
* Micro-interventions (breath timer, grounding flow).
* Resources page (helplines, low-cost counseling).

**Day 3**

* Hindi localization, tone polish, accessibility.
* Metrics, test suite for crisis phrases.
* 90-sec demo recording + 6-slide deck.

---

# 90-second demo script (what to show)

1. Open app → “Anonymous mode: ON”.
2. Type: “Assignments bahut hain, anxiety ho rahi.” → empathetic reply + 90-sec breathing.
3. Quick check-in saved → trend graph updates.
4. Switch to Hindi mid-chat.
5. Type crisis phrase (scripted). Crisis UI pops: grounding → helpline → “connect to counselor”.
6. End with privacy badge + metrics slide.

---

# Stretch ideas (if you blaze through)

* **On-device journaling** (IndexedDB) with AES encryption.
* **Clinician portal (mock)** to review anonymized patterns.
* **Personalized plans** (sleep, focus, social anxiety) with weekly goals.

---

If you want, I can now generate:

* A **ready-to-paste system prompt** + **6 few-shot examples**, or
* A **Flask endpoint spec** (request/response JSON), or
* A **6-slide pitch deck outline**.

Tell me which deliverable you want first.
